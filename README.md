# PythonProject

These two Python files are separate college assignments. 

Ch09 - imports pickle which allows us to convert Python object into a byte stream to store it in files or database, maintain prograqm state across sessions and transport data over a network. The first part of this program creates a file or if the file name already exists, it loads the file into the program. Then it asks for student data: number of students, first name, last name, gpa and validates the input. If the input does not match the parameters then the user will be prompted to reenter a valid value. Lastly, it will print out the user input to the console.

The second part of this Ch09 program pulls information from a dictionary in relation to the user's input choice. Once again, a validator is in place to ensure the correct data type and range is input by the user.

Ch10 - simply sets and then gets data from a dictionary.
